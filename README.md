## Description

“Bot Discord de apoio a Unidades Curriculares do DEISI” (Discord Bot to support DEISI Curricular Units - Bot) is a part of an information collection system about students, developed for the Department of Computer Engineering and Information systems of University Lusófona de Lisboa and aims to collect information in a discord server and computes the statistics based on the students’ participation that helps each other in the clarification of doubts about lessons, practice sheets, projects, etc, which in turn suppresses the need to send emails to teachers.

The Bot will make statistics from the gathering of data about the students. This applies when they make pertinent and relevant questions, or when a student is answering other students’ questions correctly. It’s up to the teachers to make this decision. Whenever the teacher reacts to the question/answer of a student the Bot will collect this data and is going to save it so at the end he can make a student record. “Specific skills for specific tasks”. In this way, small court discussions are created, resulting in a group evolution.
